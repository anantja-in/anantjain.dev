![I ran for 10–20 seconds, then walked for 2–3 minutes, then tried to run some more and so on.](/assets/blog/18-months-apart-what-marathon-training-looks-like/asset-1.jpeg)![My heart struggled to pump out blood to a 240 pound blob of 40% fat.](/assets/blog/18-months-apart-what-marathon-training-looks-like/asset-2.jpeg)![But, the point is, I stayed out there for 30 minutes, huffing and puffing, and ended up going through 2.2 miles, burning the equivalent of 2 cookies.](/assets/blog/18-months-apart-what-marathon-training-looks-like/asset-3.jpeg)
