Selling to enterprises as a seed-stage startup is a challenge, and security & compliance can quickly become the biggest blocker. While large enterprises have a dedicated security team, most startups don't have that luxury. Here are three key learnings from navigating security and compliance in enterprise sales at an early-stage startup.

## 1. 10x Value Prop: Why You Over an Incumbent?

Enterprise buyers prefer vendors with a strong security posture. If an existing, larger vendor can solve the same problem, they will almost always get the deal simply because they have a more mature security program.

To compete, your product must be **10x better** in a way that truly matters to your champion inside the enterprise. Whether it's speed, automation, UX, or a completely novel capability, your product needs to be **so compelling** that your buyer is willing to push their security team to take a chance on you.

## 2. Hosting: The Enterprise CISOs’ Hesitation with New Platforms

If you're using platforms like **Render or Railway**, expect pushback. These platforms are *excellent* for getting your weekend project up and running, but many CISOs have (surprisingly!) never heard of them and won’t feel comfortable with anything outside of **AWS, GCP, or Azure**—platforms they already trust.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- **Single Tenancy**: Start thinking about it early. Offering an enterprise the option to deploy in their own VPC can remove security roadblocks.
- **Cloud Provider Transparency**: If you must use an alternative platform, be ready with detailed security documentation, SOC 2 reports (if available), and a clear explanation of how your hosting provider ensures security.

## 3. The Hidden Costs of Security

One thing that constantly disappointed me was that most vendors (looking at you Github, JamfNow, etc.) put critical security features like Event Audit logs behind an Enterprise plan, which can cost 3-10x as much as other plans. A major roadblock for startups implementing a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution** is access to these critical vendor audit logs. For a **small startup**, upgrading to enterprise plans across multiple vendors is prohibitively expensive.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

- **Prioritize Logs That Matter**: Focus on the vendors with the most security-critical logs (e.g., cloud provider, authentication systems).
- **Work with Your Enterprise Customers**: If they require compliance standards, ask if they have preferred vendors or subsidized solutions to help you meet their requirements.

## Final Thoughts

Security and compliance at a seed-stage startup selling to enterprises can seem like an uphill battle, but understanding these challenges early can help you navigate them effectively. Focus on a **compelling value prop**, make sure you think about security your enterprise customers data early on, and find creative ways to **work around costs** without breaking the bank.
