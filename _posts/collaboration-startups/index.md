It seems like every other tech company is trying to become the first app you open in the morning. The operative buzzword here seems to be "collaboration". Not everyone wants to be a one-in-all solution. Still, I keep thinking about the sheer number of starting points:

1. Email: SuperHuman, Front...
2. Calendar: Google, Calendly...
3. Communication: Slack, MS Teams, (+Zoom, Loom)...
4. Todos/Project Management: Asana, ProductBoard...
5. Wikis: Notion, Coda, GDocs...
6. Storage: Box, Dropbox, GDrive...
7. Enterprise search: FYI, Workona, Command E...
8. Custom Internal tools: Airtable, Zapier...
9. CRM: Affinity, Salesforce, Airtable...

 from LSVP](https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/mapping-workplace-collaboration-startups-526915751b0e). This is the post I wanted to write here! But, since she's already done the hard work, I highly recommend you read that instead.
