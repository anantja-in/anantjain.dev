Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Anant**. Welcome to my little home on the web.

I live in **San Francisco, CA** where Iâ€™m building [**Commonlounge**](https://www.commonlounge.com) with two of my friends â€”it has courses with up-to-date, bite-sized lessons that deliver the most value for the time you invest in. You should check it out!

![In case you were wondering what I actually look like. Also, yes, that IS my Snapcode.](./asset-1.jpeg)

Other than that, Iâ€™m into **fitness, books, electronic music, art, design**, and of course, my original passion: computer science, and more broadly **technology** and its _insane_ potential to shape the world around us.

I went to college at **IIT Delhi** which is a little school back in my home town of **New Delhi** and moved to the Bay Area after for work.

A year or two ago, I started organizing floating thoughts in my head before they get lost for good. These were usually small, but interesting observations that I came across my work in startups, and in general, in life. I started collecting them in a notebook, and now want to use this blog to share these with everyone.

In addition to that, I want to get better at writing. Itâ€™s another muscle that gets better with exercise, and converting these thoughts into coherent essays seems like a good workout!

For these two reasons, I started this blog on Medium, and I used to call it Low-Pass Filter. A Low-Pass Filter is an electronic circuit that lets through low-frequency signals and attenuates the rest. I intended to apply a metaphorical Low Pass filter to events or observations I come across in tech, fitness and more broadly, in life, and write about them here.

However, I started 2018 with a goal to publish one book review a week for the entire year. It was mostly to force myself to write something every weekend, and also to retain what I read better. Over time, as the readership grew (and most of whom didnâ€™t want to do anything with low-pass filters!), I realized that itâ€™s better to drop that name, and run this just as my personal blog.

In addition to book reviews, Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™ll be able to proceed with the original plan and publish at least one essay a month on something interestingâ€Šâ€”â€Ševen if itâ€™s based on an old idea or thought. Wish me luck!

Before you go away, here are two more cool links about me: I put some of my more _arty_ stuff on my [Instagram (anantja_in)](https://www.instagram.com/anantja_in/) and share shorter thoughts and talk to people on [Twitter (anantja_in](https://twitter.com/anantja_in)). Or if you prefer, email me at [me@anantja.in](mailto:me@anantja.in).

Here are two giant links belowâ€Šâ€”â€Šcome say hi!
