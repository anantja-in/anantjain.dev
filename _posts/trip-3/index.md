#### The journey is the destination

Since there’s nowhere to really get to, it is the pursuit of something higher — _the journey_, that itself is the destination. As soon as you get somewhere, that somewhere loses its beauty and becomes your new reality. Pause and look around for a bit. The reality right now is so beautiful; it is almost a piece of art. But most people treat everyday life as if there’s nothing special to it, and that lets them aspire to get somewhere even better, somehow. And that aspiration is what makes it worth it all. That aspiration takes you on the journey. And that journey is the destination. That’s why you got to keep aspiring and keep moving. Since the act of walking, of doing things, of creating, of writing, is what makes it worth our while here on this one-time lease. You have to stay hungry. You have to stay foolish.

#### Tourist in your own city

I think I’ll always be a tourist in San Francisco. It never ceases to amaze me how many things can be housed in such a small area. The tourists know where the best things are — the tourist attractions still are some of the best things any city can offer. And while we roam around on this trip pretending to be tourists in our own city, ain’t we the soul of the city, the hippie kids of the ’60s, transported into the current day that the tourists came to look at. Aren’t the tourists the tourist attraction?

#### What is art? Who is an artist?

Art is something that pauses you for a moment and makes you take a second look — a Picasso, a Rothko, a Banksy, a pretty face. It is something which brings out the contrasts and puts them right in your face. It is something that lets you see the world better, that makes you a little more aware of it.

It is something that has been stolen from the trip — the part of your brain that prevents sensory overload has been put to rest for a few hours, and with no one watching over your senses anymore, your brain is filled up with an explosion of billions of signals from every sensor on your body. While your brain tries to make sense of this sensory freedom (or overload, if you may), you suddenly realize why “Steal Like an Artist” is such a true quote.

**_Real artists steal_**. Only, they do it from the trip. They take it back and put it in front of people who have never seen that before in a way that they can understand it. They steal it from this reality — but that’s the whole beauty of it — this other reality is the only other reality there is. It is the life we live every day. And things fly by with no one noticing. And artists make us pause and make us look into this everyday life, with a new angle — which we thought we’d never be able to see before.

Only if we had ever paused to attempt that, we would be an artist too. For, an artist is someone audacious enough to do something for the sake of doing it, often not even realizing at the moment they are creating art that they are creating art. Art, where the rules have not been set yet, where you push your notions of what the word means. Things that are already out there for everyone to see and make something out of, and put it back for others to see, pause and marvel at the genius of the theft.
