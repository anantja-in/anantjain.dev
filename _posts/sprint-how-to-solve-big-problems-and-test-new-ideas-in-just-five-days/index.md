The Sprint process was developed at Google Ventures by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. It’s a highly effective process for solving problems by building prototypes and user-testing them over a span of five days. _Sprint_ is almost a required reading for everyone in the tech industry — from the executives to the engineers. I’ve recommended this book to more people than I can remember and recently realized that I haven’t published an official review of this book here, or have one place with all the links to my writings on it. I’m rectifying that this week.

First, here’s a small 90-second video summarizing the process:

The following 5 tutorials go through some of the key ideas and processes within the Sprint process (they also link to each other — so opening the first one would be enough)

[**The Sprint Process Day 1: Start at the End, Make a map and Ask the Experts**](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/74249b8823624554b51a4e68dd15c022 "https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/74249b8823624554b51a4e68dd15c022")

[**The Sprint Process Day 2: Remix & Improve and Sketch**](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/e9dedfe4fb564fb8aafd6bafa6a9f23a)

[**The Sprint Process Day 3: Decide, Rumble and Storyboard**](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/08c63da85e194873aca4de29d25f5c98)

[**The Sprint Process Day 4: Prototype**](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/233456d3d410481d85804318efa5b0c9)

[**The Sprint Process Day 5: Test and Learn**](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/4370acc07a174a6fab652209531d24c8)

These ideas/processes in this book are applicable outside of running a sprint as well — in particular, when it comes to making decisions quickly or interviewing users. I wrote another post for UXPlanet earlier this year with this theme:

[**16 UX Design tools from the Sprint Process**](https://uxplanet.org/16-ux-design-tools-from-the-sprint-process-b6ca467b30ad)

That’s about it! The authors also wrote _Make Time_ that I [reviewed](https://anantjain.dev/make-time-how-to-focus-on-what-matters-every-day-e793d6544b24) earlier this year. I can’t recommend both books enough!

_This is #48 in a series of book reviews published weekly on this site._
