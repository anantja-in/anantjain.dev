I wrote this as a Twitter thread and not a proper blog post mainly to try out their [new](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/nicethreads.html) threads composition interface. But when I thought about it a bit more, I realized it’s probably better to write Twitter threads since people already spend much more time on Twitter compared to Medium, and it’s always a better idea to go where people already are rather than making them find you.

Just a thought; not stopping writing here any time soon.
