![Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions](/assets/blog/decisive/decisive-book-cover.jpg)

I really liked Heath Brothers' books _Made to Stick_ ([Review](/made-to-stick-why-some-ideas-survive-and-others-die/)) and _Power of Moments_ ([Review](/the-power-of-moments/)) earlier, and decided to give _Decisive_ a shot.

In _Decisive_, the authors condense some of the foundational ideas in psychology into the _"WRAP Framework"_ that you can use to improve your decision-making:

- **W: Widen your options** by avoiding a narrow frame, multitracking (considering multiple ideas simultaneously), and finding someone who has solved your problem before.
- **R: Reality-test your assumptions** by considering the opposite, zooming out and zooming in, and "ooching", i.e., constructing small experiments to test your hypothesis.
- **A: Attain distance before deciding** by overcoming short-term emotion and honoring your core priorities.
- **P: Prepare to be wrong** by bookending the future (anticipating and preparing for both adversity and success via pre-mortems and pre-parades), setting a tripwire, and trusting the process.

Some more tools/ideas that I especially liked in this book:

- Four villains of good decision-making: **Narrow framing, confirmation bias, short-term emotion, and overconfidence**.
- To escape narrow frames, be aware of “whether or not” decisions.
- When you need trustworthy information, go find an expert—someone more experienced than you. **Just keep them talking about the past and the present, not the future.** I really liked this heuristic around how to deal with "experts", who are usually as wrong as it gets about the future.
- **10/10/10 analysis**: Think about a decision on three different time frames: How will you feel about it 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months from now? How about 10 years from now?

Overall, this book is another one of those I can safely recommend you to skip if you've already read _Thinking Fast and Slow_ ([Review](/thinking-fast-and-slow/)). Otherwise, it's a good fun read if it's one of the first psychology books that you're picking up.
