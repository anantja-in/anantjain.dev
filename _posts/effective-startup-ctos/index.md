## Introduction  
Measuring your performance as a Startup CTO at a Seed or Series A startup is a unique challenge. As the CTO[1], you're typically a founder driving direction and growth, including talking to users and building something they want. On top of that, you're writing code every day, fixing critical bugs, and managing and mentoring the engineering team. Traditional career paths for individual contributors or engineering managers don’t capture this hybrid role.

After my time at Brex, when I returned to startups, I heavily adapted the engineering career path we had. I always appreciated the way we structured the role of engineering leadership and wanted to emulate some of those values in my future roles.

The following is the rubric spanning five areas that I have been using in my own role, and numerous other Seed/Series A CTOs I've talked to about this topic have found it useful as well:

---

**A. Getting Things Done**: **Timely and efficient delivery** of solutions to real customer problems, building something users want. Tying this to top-level company metrics has typically worked best for me:
1. Increase in ARR (e.g., from X to Y)
2. Improvement in Net Revenue Retention (e.g., from X to Y)

---

**B. Technical Excellence**: **Drive technical vision** and **strategy,** promoting a culture of building scalable, maintainable, and reliable systems. Something as simple as DORA metrics is sufficient in the earliest stages.

1. Deployment Frequency
2. Lead time to deployment
3. Change Failure Rate
4. Mean Time to Restore

---

**C. Direction**: Shape the **product and technical direction** for the company.

1. Technical bets that keep execution as fast as today a year from now.
2. Technical bets that simplify the tech stack or keep it simple.
3. Technical/Product bets that add a 10x competitive differentiation.

---

**D. Recruiting and Growth**: Be the primary point person for sourcing, interviewing, closing, and retaining **top engineering talent** throughout the company, as well as developing **leaders**.

1. Engineering headcount growth
2. Counter-metric of attrition (including non-regretted)

---

**E. Culture**: Accountable for the health of engineering team. Drive **growth**, **development**, and **calibration** of all engineers.

1. Employee Retention
2. Developer happiness (you can run monthly surveys, but usually this is quite subjective to measure at this stage)

[1] By CTO, I’m referring to the person who the engineering team reports to. In some startups, there’s a CTO (usually a cofounder) who is a better fit as the “chief architect” and hires a VP Engineering / Head of Engineering / etc. to actually manage and grow the team.
