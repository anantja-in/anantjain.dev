It’s very hard to explain the trip. You can say it is what you make of it, and yet you’re really not in control. It’s all in your mind. There are no physical impairments as in the case of alcohol, and that’s what imparts it its beauty. You’re fully capable and in control of yourself, and your mind, yet there’s a different state you’re in — one that you can’t really turn off. It’s a realm somewhere in the middle of dreams and reality. In the movie The Waking Life, the protagonist is imparted with rare wisdom — in a dream, try tuning a light off, and you won’t be able to. Here, you can turn the lights on and off all you want, and make sure you’re not in a dream, but that makes it all the more hard. You’d wish you were in a dream since that’ll explain a lot and make things easier to understand.

When you're on the trip, you’re in the driver’s seat. You decide what’s going to happen next. You decide where you’re going to go next. Where your life’s going to go next. Making life decisions is ridiculously simple once you’re here. Since you’re able to see what you were, are and will be. Soon, the realization that you’re way more in control of everything that you ever thought possible sets in. For a moment, and just for a moment before you snap out of it, you can be those air molecules next to the diaphragm in the speaker, or you can be the neuron in your brain that fires right before a keystroke.

You start wondering about the ultimate existential problems: who are you, where you come from, and is it some kind of a game you are stuck in. Is it possible I’m still in Big Sur and just dozed off on the beach and dreaming all this up, or am I really back home, and typing out a post about this trip. Does it even matter? Is it possible that this is not me, but just someone else typing off this somewhere else? I don't really know.
